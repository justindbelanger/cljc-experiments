* What is this project?
It's an experiment into loading a pickle file (in the original use case,
one containing metadata about a machine-learning model)
using [[https://github.com/clj-python/libpython-clj][libpython-clj]].

Doubtful that I'll add anything more to it at this point,
because I'm not keen on the security risks posed by pickle files,
but it's good to know that the option exists.
